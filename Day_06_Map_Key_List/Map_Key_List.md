## Answers to Exercise Level 1 Questions
### Answer to Question 1
<br>
<p align="justify">
1. <strong>Dynamic Content :</strong> When the items to be displayed have a dynamic list, the mapping tries to dynamically create a React Component for each item.<br><br>
2. <strong> Reusability : </strong> Mapping encourages the reuse of components. This leads to shorter code and easy maintenance. <br><br>
3. <strong>Scalability :</strong> Using the map allows the code to automatically adapt even if the data size changes. <br><br>
4. <strong>Maintainability :</strong> Mapping over an array helps to increase the maintainability of the code.<br><br>
   
### Answer to Question 2
<p align="justify">Keys help React identify items that have been changed, added, or removed. A key is needed to give a stable identity to the elements in array. <strong><i>The key must be unique.</strong></i> In general, the data that comes as the ID can be used as the key. If the key is not used, React will send an error message to the browser console.</p> <br><br>
